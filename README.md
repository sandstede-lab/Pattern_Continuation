## Description

This software computes pattern statistics in spatially extended systems and uses them for bifurcation tracing. Depending on the task, typically it requires (1) an initial value problem solver which generates desired patterns, e.g. snapshots of Brusselator in spatial dimension 2 at a certain terminal time; (2) a pattern statistic to be used when performing the bifurcation tracing task.

## Requirement

MATLAB
